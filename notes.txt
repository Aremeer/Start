Functions
    Functions are verbs or actions that the computer or computer language will already know how to perform.


Variables
    A variable is just a container for a value within your own program.
        name = input("What's your name? ")
        print("hello," name)


Comments
    Comments are a way for programmers to track what they are doing in their programs and even inform others about their intentions for a block of code. In short, they are notes for yourself and others that will see your code!
        # Ask the user for their name


Pseudocode
        # Ask the user for their name
        name = input("What's your name? ")

        # Print hello
        print("hello,")

        # Print the name inputted
        print(name)


Strings and Paremeters
    A string, known as a str in Python, is a sequence of text.
    Looking at this documentation, you’ll learn that the print function automatically include a piece of code end='\n'. This \n indicates that the print function will automatically create a line break when run. The print function takes an argument called end` and the default is to create a new line.

        # Ask the user for their name
        name = input("What's your name? ")
        print("hello,", end="")
        print(name)


Formatting Strings
    Probably the most elegant way to use strings would be as follows:

        # Ask the user for their name
        name = input("What's your name? ")
        print(f"hello, {name}")

    Notice the f in print(f"hello, {name}"). This f is a special indicator to Python to treat this string a special way, different than previous approaches we have illustrated in this lecture. Expect that you will be using this style of strings quite frequently in this course.
    

More on Strings
    You should never expect your user will cooperate as intended. Therefore, you will need to ensure that the input of your user is corrected or checked.
    
    strip - By utilizing the method strip on name as name = name.strip(), it will strip all the whitespaces on the left and right of the users input. You can modify your code to be:
        name = name.strip()

    title - Using the title method, it would title case the user’s name:
        nname = name.title()
        
    We could even go further!
        name = input("What's your name? ").strip().title()


= sign has a special role in programming. This equal sign literally assigns what is on the right to what is on the left.
